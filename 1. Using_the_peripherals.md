# How to use the peripherals

The LITA Carrier Board was designed to accelerate the process to build a Robot.
Then in this Tutorial you can learn how to use the more important sensors:

a. 4 Cameras MIPI-CSI2
b. GPS
c. IMU

The Carrier board have 4 MIPI CSI-2 cameras connectors ready to use with cameras Compatible with Raspberry PI with a 15 pins connector.
To work correctly is necessary to do the Installation step where the system is updated to:

- Enable the PW_DN PINs used in each camera.
- Update the device tree to understand the configuration using the TCA9548 Multiplexer required to work with only 1 i2C and provide the signal to each camera using the port #70 to switch between then.

After that you can connect the 4 cameras and validated that the cameras are working correctly looking in the /dev folder, where you can find:

/dev/video0
/dev/video1
/dev/video2
/dev/video3

Additionally you can validate that the cameras are running with 

dmesg |  grep imx
