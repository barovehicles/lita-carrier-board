# How to use the peripherals

The LITA Carrier Board was designed to accelerate the process to build a Robot.
Then in this Tutorial you can learn how to use the more important sensors:

*a. 4 Cameras MIPI-CSI2
*b. GPS
*c. IMU

The Carrier board have 4 MIPI CSI-2 cameras connectors ready to use with cameras Compatible with Raspberry PI with a 15 pins connector.

Currently we re offering support for four IMX219 cameras or four VEYE327 cameras.

To work correctly is necessary to do the Installation step where the system is updated to:

- Enable the PW_DN PINs used in each camera.
- Update the device tree to understand the configuration using the TCA9548 Multiplexer required to work with only 1 i2C and provide the signal to each camera using the port #70 to switch between then.

After that you can connect the 4 cameras and validated that the cameras are working correctly looking in the /dev folder, where you can find:

*/dev/video0
*/dev/video1
*/dev/video2
*/dev/video3

Additionally you can validate that the cameras are running with 

dmesg |  grep imx

And you need to see:

```
[    3.933783] imx219 30-0010: tegracam sensor driver:imx219_v2.0.6
[    3.960087] imx219 31-0010: tegracam sensor driver:imx219_v2.0.6
[    3.986224] imx219 32-0010: tegracam sensor driver:imx219_v2.0.6
[    4.012536] imx219 33-0010: tegracam sensor driver:imx219_v2.0.6
[    5.638779] vi 54080000.vi: subdev imx219 30-0010 bound
[    5.645943] vi 54080000.vi: subdev imx219 32-0010 bound
[    5.646658] vi 54080000.vi: subdev imx219 31-0010 bound
[    5.647364] vi 54080000.vi: subdev imx219 33-0010 bound

```

If you can see it. Then we re ready to use the cameras.

You can use the follow line to see the camera 0 (sensor_id=0): 


```
gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc sensor_id=0 ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=3820, height=2464, framerate=21/1, format=NV12' ! nvvidconv flip-method=0 ! 'video/x-raw,width=960, height=616' ! nvvidconv ! nvegltransform ! nveglglessink -e
```

You can download the follow script:

and execute chmod 777 cc

The parameter is the camera number 0 to 3 to see each camera:

./cc 0
