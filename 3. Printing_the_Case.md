We developed a Case to be used with our LITA Carrier Board and facilitate the development using the 4 cameras thinking in several cases of use.
Our kit allow to use LITA with all your projects related to robotics or computer vision.


The kit allow to put the Case on the desk or fixed to the robot.

 #### Car Windscreen Support 

The Kit for the WindScreen is a special bracket to be used with LITA in a Vehicle with windscreen. Then is possible to fix the LITA correctly to do testing with different MIPI cameras.
