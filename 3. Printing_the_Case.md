1. We developed a Case to be used with our LITA Carrier Board and facilitate the development using the 4 cameras thinking in several cases of use.

The kit allow to put the Case on the desk. Install the board inside a robot or put the LITA on the Windscreen of your car. With our brackets designed for this purpose.
